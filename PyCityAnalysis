To summarize the analysis, the percent overall passing for each school can be a result of any of the calculations made. In each school, the budget and total number of students effects their test scores. 

A few conclusions can be drawn from the calculations. In reviewing the highest and lowest performing schools by percentage overall passing, I have noticed the highest performing schools are all charter schools with lower student totals and larger budget than the lowest performing schools being district schools. Based on the grouping by spending per student, it is interesting though that the percent overall passing goes down as the budget get larger. On the otherhand, based on the grouping by school size, it does follow logic that the percent overall passing gets lower as the school sizes get larger.
